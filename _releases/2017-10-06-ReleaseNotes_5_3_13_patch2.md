# CMSSW_5_3_13_patch2
#1250: remove compilation warning in 5_3_X Fireworks/SimData, merge fixes for DT segment visualization
#1276: Added sequence to compute isolation of muons from boosted tau -> mu decays
#1346: Simple workaround to hide FF proxybuilder in cmsShow. Proper solution implemented in 7_0_X.
#1352: Fix for IB and other HLT tests (53X / 62X / 70X).
#1359: A bug was fixed. Now a histogram will be made to take care of muon double counting when using MuEnriched samples.
